## Purpose
Craifter empowers users to create, manage, and automate command-line tasks through organized "sessions." It combines task tracking (todos) with executable command storage, enabling efficient workflow automation for developers, sysadmins, and productivity enthusiasts. Built with AI assistance in mind, it bridges manual task management and automated execution.

## Reasoning
This project was created to address the need for deeper automation of AI-assisted tasks on the command line. While AI systems like Grok can generate commands and ideas, executing and organizing them into reusable workflows often requires manual effort. Craifter provides a structured way to save, track, and replay commands generated by AI, reducing repetitive work and enhancing productivity. It evolved from a desire to make AI-generated scripts persistent and executable, turning one-off suggestions into automated sessions.

## Features
- **Session Management**: Create and organize projects with persistent storage.
- **Command Execution**: Save and run shell commands within sessions.
- **Todo Tracking**: Manage tasks with priorities and statuses.
- **Playback & Automation**: Review and execute saved workflows.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Full CLI support with interactive and direct modes.
- **Persistence**: Sessions and commands saved to disk for reuse.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/cshaiku/craifter.git`
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd craifter`
3. Compile: `g++ -std=c++17 -o craifter main.cpp`
4. Install globally: `sudo mv craifter /usr/bin/craifter`
5. Ensure sessions directory: `mkdir -p /root/craifter/sessions`

## Usage
Run Craifter interactively: `craifter`
Or use command-line arguments: `craifter <command>`

## Examples
### Basic Todo Management
```bash
craifter addtodo fix_bug "Fix login issue" high
craifter showtodos
craifter updatetodo fix_bug completed
```

### Session and Command Management
```bash
craifter newsession deploy_app
craifter savecommand deploy_app "git add ."
craifter savecommand deploy_app "git commit -m 'Auto-commit'"
craifter savecommand deploy_app "git push origin main"
craifter savenote deploy_app "Deployment workflow for app updates"
craifter playback deploy_app  # View saved commands and notes
craifter runproject deploy_app  # Execute the commands
```

### Listing and Managing Sessions
```bash
craifter listsessions
craifter newsession new_project
```
